# Thesis Project

Companion project to my Bachelor's thesis, consisting of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for tweaking the parameters of various Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) cells. Once satisfied with the cell, a script can be copied to the clipboard. Running said script in the XFdtd simulation software, builds the models of the cell and begins running simulations to determine the cell's properties.
